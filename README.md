# Us-sales-insights

This project involved working with the SalesData dataset from Kaggle, which contains sales information for various products across different cities in the United States. The dataset includes columns such as Quantity, PriceEach, OrderDate, PurchaseAddress, Month, Sales, City, Hour, and OrderID.

ðŸ’» Methodology:

1. Imported libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

2. Conducted an exploratory data analysis using .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand the structure and values of the dataset.

3. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates and replacing missing values with the mean to ensure consistency.

4. Created various bar charts:

  .Vertical bars showing the quantity of products sold per city.

  .Vertical bars showing sales per product.

  .Horizontal bars for quantity per product.

  .Horizontal bars for sales per city.

For all visualizations, I applied different color maps and combined the capabilities of Matplotlib with NumPy to produce clear and professional charts.
